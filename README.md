My first attempt at building a simple weather application using Node.js and Express.js.
This application uses the EJS templating engine to render customised views basis weather data recieved from the API.
The API's used to provide location based weather data are https://weatherstack.com/.
Just run the server.js file in the project root and see it in action yourself.
Any suggestions on what could have been better are always welcome.
